Usermanual for System

IMPORTANT INFO FOR SYSTEM:
Stop the system if the moisture level goes above 70%
This level is damaging for electronics, and can cause catastrophic system failure!

How to use the system:
1. Connect all disconnected cables. [IR_Camera to PC, Arduino to PC, Power to LITOS]
2. Start Up C# Software
3. Initiate the LITOS, then initiate C# Software
4. Let the system run!

LITOS:

Before setting up a pattern: LITOS can max be off for 5 --> 9 seconds, under 5s parameter the Camera will take picture 
while the LITOS device is on, any parameter over 9s the device will turn off and stop sending information to the computer.
Safe area for how long device should be off is 6-8 seconds. This is only relevant for when the system is running and not in start
sequence or end sequence.
 
1. How to set a pattern for LITOS device: ( https://github.com/pertzlab/LITOS/wiki/4.-Running-an-experiment )
	- This link gives step by step instruction on how to operate the LITOS device. 

C#:

To start the software: OptogeneticStimulaiton\OptogeneticStimulaiton\bin\Debug in here u will find an .exe file that will run the program, if you dont want to run it with Visual studio. 

When you start the C# software it will ask for Camera device. Select camera and proceed.
Then you must check the COM port to find the correct port. When you found correct port you can start the c# code.

If the camera don't work, download the driver:  ( https://www.theimagingsource.com/en-no/product/industrial/33u/dmk33up1300/ )

Arduino:

If arduino sensors or servo is not operating as expected, re upload the code. // not necessary, if system runs as expected!
Open the .ino file, connect the usb to pc.
Go to: Tools --> Board --> "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini". // the reason for this is that this arduino is a clone. 
Go to: Port --> Choose COM(x), after which USB you connected to your PC. Usually PORT3 or PORT4. 

If you cant find the arduino, download the driver for this device. 
Link: ( https://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html ), this device is CH340G

If the device still don't work, check the cable!
