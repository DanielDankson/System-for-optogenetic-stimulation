All these prints are last revision. 

Info for printer:
The file format ufp is translated directly by the printer into the print.
We used different color's PLA, if the printer says its wrong filaments, it's most likeley a mismatch on the color. 
Bewary that these prints are designed for PLA on an ultimaker device.
